<h2><b><a name="install"></a>Install.</b></h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just run setup program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using Windows 98 Simplified Chineese and
filter's property dialog is too small you can try <b>dialog_patch.exe</b>
patch (run it again to revert  changes).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For normal filter operation all accompaniment files
are not required and shipped only for serviceability. The only required
module is <b>ac3filter.ax</b>. This module is also Control Panel
configuration module for itself. For W2K+ it can be registred in
registry key <b>[HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control
Panel\Cpls]</b>. But for W98 compatibility at installation it is copied
to windows system folder with .cpl extension.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h2><b><a name="uninstall"></a>Uninstall.</b><br>
</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just run uninstaller from Start Menu or Control

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">! Note that all your saved
matrices, equaliers etc will be lost !</font><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible that filter was installed with one of
codec packs. In this case most simple way to uninstall codec is to
uninstall this codec pack. If you want to uninstall only this codec you
may uninstall it manually:
<ul>
  <li>Find ac3filter.ax file.</li>
  <li>Unregister this module from command line: &gt;regsvr32 /u
x:\some_dir\ac3filter.ax</li>
  <li>Find and delee files ac3filter.ax and ac3filter.cpl</li>
  <li>Delete registry key HKCU\Software\AC3Filter<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h2><a name="system_setup"></a>System setup</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If installation was successful then in most cases
filter is ready to work immediately and does not require any settings.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most compatible mode of operation is stereo mode. It
should work with any Windows version and any sound card.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some drivers (Creative!) do not update settings in '<b>Control
Panel-&gt;Sounds and Multimedia-&gt;Audio-&gt;Sound
Playback-&gt;Advanced</b>' after speaker configuration change in
drivers. So it is necessary to check it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible that some audio processing filter
(equalizers, enhancer, etc) may handle multichannel audio format
incorrectly and cause problems with playback. For example center channel
may fairly disappear or it will be impossible to change speaker
configuration at playback time. To prevent this things do not install
filter-packs and unregister unnecessary filters.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of problematic filters is <b>mmswitch</b> filter
(filter that support .avi and DVDs with several audio tracks and allow
to switch between it, especially   for multi-language films). If you
mainly watch DVDs it is better  to uninstall this filter and use MPEG2
parser wich support   stream  switching directly (standard <b>MPEG2
Splitter</b> for example). In this case you'll also get lower   CPU
usage. If MPEG2 parser does not support stream switching (<b>Elecard</b>
for example) then many audio rendering chains are created, and all of
them are working together when only one is really reproduced.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If <b>mmswitch</b> is really needed  then   it  is
several possibilities:<br>
<ul>
  <li>All audio streams are ac3. For correct stream switching all
decoders must have the same output format.<br>
  </li>
  <li>First stream is ac3, and second is mp3 (or any other non-
multichannel). Before switching to mp3 stream ac3 must be configured to
16bit stereo.</li>
  <li>First stream is mp3 and second is ac3. Before switching to ac3
filter must be confugured to 16bit stereo. You can change output format
after switching.</li>
</ul>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of system settings may be configured from
filter properties page (read <a href="#usage">Filter configuration</a>
to know how to call it):<br>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="pic/system.gif" title="" alt="" width="628" height="429"><br>
</div>
<br>
<b>* Filter merit</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After installation filter have highest priority,
i.e. it will be used instead of any other installed ac3 decoder. If for
any reason it is needed to use other decoder it is possible to decrease
filter's priority to minimal with '<b>Prefer other decoder'</b>. In this
case filter will be used only if it is no other decoders installed. It
is needed for example to use NVDVD player. It can only use its own
decoder. But with AC3Filter installed NVDVD tries to load AC3Filter
instead and cannot proceed. To revert high priority choose <b>'Prefer
AC3Filter</b>'. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This option requires relogon in W2k/XP and system
restart in W98.<br>
<br>
<b>* Default audio renderer</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound card may work in two modes: DirectSound and
WaveOut. If it is some problems when using filter (for example if SPDIF
does not work) it is possible that mode switch may help. Some media
players (BSP) have corresponding settings but most of others use system
default settings. Choose <b>'Use DirectSound'</b> to make DirectSound to
be default interface; choose <b>'Use WaveOut</b>' to make WaveOut to be
default interface.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This option requires relogon in W2k/XP and system
restart in W98.<br>
<br>
<b> * Audio/Video sync.</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes it may happen that audio and video are not
in sync. Mostly it happens because of incorrect mixing, but it may be
also some hardware reasons. This option is designed to fix <b>hardware</b>
issues. You can use it to watch movies that was incorrectly mixed but do
not forget to change it back after! This option specifies time shift
between audio and video. If audio is played <u><i>before</i></u> video
you need to <u><i>increase</i></u> this value. If audio is played <u><i>after</i></u>
video you need to <u><i>decrease</i></u> this value. Note, that this
option allows to fix only constant time shift.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This option have immediate effect. When you change
it picture may freeze for several seconds to resync, it is normal.<br>
<br>
<b>* System options</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Auto load movie configuration files</b> - If this
option is enabled filter will try to find and load configuration file
with the same name as media file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Generate timestamps</b> - This option may affect
video stuttering. Try to switch it if you see video stuttering,
non-fluent video. It is most common case when this option is enabled. In
this case filter will calculate time for each ac3 frame decoded. But
this time may differ from time got from media file (in fact times are
always different for .avi files) and this may produce video stuttering
on some systems. It does not mean that filter calculate timestamps
incorrectly or timestamps in media file are incorrect, but it is a
general problem of .avi files with frame-based interleaving. Partially
this porblem may be solved with '<b>Jitter correction</b>' option.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this option is disabled filter will use only
timestamps from media file. This may solve the problem with different
timestamps. But in this case some decoded ac3 frames will have no
timestamps at all. Some players/drivers cannot handle this situation
correctly and may produce stuttering/frozen frames or other unpleasant
effects.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Jitter Correction</b> - works only when '<b>Generate
timestamps</b>' is enabled. Decrease the stutterring due to the
difference between calculated and received timestamps. '<b>Current jitter</b>'
shows the current  amplitude of deviations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Use WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE</b> - generally for
multichannel modes it is WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE structure used (described
at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/tech/audio/multichaud.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/tech/audio/multichaud.asp</a>).
Some old drivers cannot work with it (opposite, some new drivers can
work only with this structure in multichannel).<br>
<br>

<h2><b><a name="usage"></a>Filter configuration.</b><br>
</h2>
<big><i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First it is two main rules of tuning:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. If you do not understand what some option does do
not touch it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If you did not follow the first rule and broke
anything and do not know how to fix it just load 'standart' preset.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)))<br>
</i></big><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filter can be configured with several ways. Best is
if player allow to call filter properties (WMP 6.4, BSP, Sasami, etc,
not in WMP 7, 8, 9!).&nbsp;For example in WMP 6.4 filter list can be
accessed <b>File- &gt;Properties-&gt;Advanced</b>:<br>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="pic/filters.gif" alt="" width="425" height="435"> <br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If player does not allow to reach filter settings it
is possible to configure it from Start menu with '<b>AC3Filter Config</b>'
icon or Control Panel icon. But this method do not show current
activity and do not affect it! I.e. levels will not change, bitstream
information will be filled with zeros etc. Moreover all players should
be closed <i><small>(because when player is closing filter saves its
configuration to registry, so now configured values may be overwrited
with old values that was read at player startup). </small></i>So it is
highly recommended to configure filter from within player that allow
access to filter properties (almost any of widespreaded: BSPlayer,
Sasami, ZoomPlayer, LightAlloy, etc). In last case you can hear how any
change in settings affects sound. WMP v7, 8, 9 are not recommended.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="main_settings"></a>Main settings</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is <b>Main</b> property page (levels and
bitstream info are only shown when property page is called from player):<br>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="pic/main.gif" title="" alt="" width="628" height="427"> <br>
</div>
<br>
<b>* Bitstream information</b>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Top left it is bitstream information (BSI):<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Channels</b> - channels configuration  in  form
front_channels/surround_channels + LFE  (Low frequency effects channel)
presence flag. In this example     it   is 3 front, 2 surround and LFE
channels, i.e. 5.1 configuration.</li>
  <li><b>Sample rate</b> [Hz]</li>
  <li><b>Bitrate</b> [bps]</li>
  <li><b>Freq</b> (coupl/high) - [kHz], coupling frequency     and high
freuency. In ac3 some channels (in most cases   all channels) are
grouped in one coupling    channel beginning from   some frequency -
coupling frequency   and stored in   the bitstream in  that form. So
channels are really  independent   only in some   frequency   band - up
to coupling frequency. High  frequency  is a maximum frequency coded, so
it defines   total frequency bandwidth.</li>
  <li><b>Frames/errors</b> - total number of decoded frames    and
number of errors when decoding.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>* Output.</b></h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here you can change output configuration. It define
the real  speaker   configuration  to wich ac3 channels will be mixed.
Shown in  form front_channels/surround_channels + subwoofer presence
flag (SW). For some configurations common names are given. What is the
difference between LFE and subwoofer read in <a href="#lfe">What is LFE?</a>
section.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<b>Dolby Surround/ProLogic</b>' modes mean that
that all channels presented in ac3 stream will be mixed into two
channels so Dolby Surround/Pro Logic decoder can extract surround
channel. '<b>Dolby ProLogic II</b>' mode is similar to DPL but for DPL
II decoder. DPLII support is only experimental because of lack of
reliable information.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<b>SPDIF</b>' mode means that ac3 stream will be
routed to digital out of sound card directly and without any
modification. So no one of other settings will work if this checkbox is
checked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<b>Sample format</b>' combo box sets output sample
format. There are PCM 16 bit, 24 and 32 bit and PCM Float formats are
now supported. On some sound cards some formats may not work so use this
option with care.<br>
<br>
<b>* Gain levels.</b> <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here you can control gain levels.
<ul>
  <li><b>Master</b> - desired gain level.</li>
  <li><b>Gain</b> - shows current gain level.</li>
  <li><b>LFE</b> - LFE channel gain level</li>
  <li><b>Voice</b> - center channel gain level (dialogue channel)</li>
  <li><b>Surround</b> - surround channel(s) gain level..</li>
  <li><b>BSI Lock</b> checkboxes - lock channel gain level at values
given by standard. You cannot change Voice, LFE and surround gains when
it is enables.</li>
  <li><b>Normalize</b> - one-pass sound normalize. (look at <a href="#mixer">Mixer settings</a>)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Master</b> and <b>Gain</b> controls are
responsible for global gain level. <b>Master</b> sets desired gain
level. If current sound level is too high and overflow occurs then real
gain level will be decreased. Current gain level shown at <b>Gain</b>
control.<br>
<br>
<h4><b>* Dynamic range compression.</b></h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By its nature ac3 is a logarithmic format. Samples
are stored in form of exponents and mantissas. In terms of bits  one
sample can be up to 40bits   long (only theoretically) or up to 24bits
(normal). It provides huge dynamic   range (but, as said by great
Einstein all good things in this word are relative :-). This means that
quiet sound with low level when played on 16- bit sound card will be not
audible at all or will have very low absolute level (=&gt; high
distortions). To solve this problem  it is dynamic range comression.
Main idea is to raise level when sound is  quiet (and vice versa when
loud) before converting to 16-bit  form. There are special markers in
ac3 stream for current level change. This  markers are set by producer
at a mastering stage, so it guarantees   high quality. <b>DRC level</b>
indicates this level. With <b>Use DRC</b> chekbox  you can enabe/disable
using DRC. <i>(of course this is only rough problem description).</i><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>DRC Power</b> control adjusts how much <b>DRC
level</b> changes sound level. When <b>DRC Power</b> is increased all
quiet sounds will be more stressed and loud sound will be more shaded.
When <b>DRC Power</b> is decreasd dynamic range compression will have
less influence at output. Zero <b>DRC Power</b> level means that dynamic
range compression applied at normal.
<h4><b>* CPU load.</b><br>
</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indicates CPU load by sound decoding and processing.
All sound processing (if exists) before reproduction included here.
<h4><b>* Input/output levels.</b><br>
</h4>
<font color="#000000"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current audio levels
indication for each channel. Note  that   levels here are in logarithmic
scale. Input levels shows <i>real</i> channels configuration. Often

become red it indicates overflow and you need to decrease gain.<br>

<div align="center"><img src="pic/mixer.gif" title="" alt="" width="628" height="429">&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For convenience some controls from Main page are
placed here.   For its description look at <a href="file:///E:/&amp;USERS/VA/PROJECTS/AC3Filter/AC3Filter/ac3filter_0_67b/ac3filter_eng.html#main_settings">Main
settings</a>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main controls here are mixing matrix. It is in form
of matrix multiplication: S' = M*S, where S = { L, C, R, SL, SR, LFE } -
input sample, S'  = { L',    C', R', SL', SR', SW' } - output sample.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More simple it means next rule for each cell: we mix
channel specified by column to channel specified by row with gain
specified in cell. So if we want to route left channel to right speaker
we should set 1 in cell at cross of 'L' column and 'R' row. If we don't
want to hear left channel from left speakers anymore then we set 0 at
cross 'L' column and 'L' row. If we make same operation with right and
surround channel then we fully swap left and right channel. (Note, that
in this case we fully swap 'L' and 'R' rows).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is nessesary to clearly distinct concepts of
input and output channels. Input channel is what was coded in AC3
stream. Output channel is what we'll hear from speakers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Row determines what we'll hear from corresponding
output channel. For matrix shown above from left chanel we'll hear 1
part of input left channel, part of center channel, lowered left
surround and LFE.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column determines where input channel will be mixed.
For matrix shown above center channel will be routed to left and right
channel with factor 0.7. So we'll hear center channel in center of left
and right speakers. If we make it louder in one of speakers then center
will be 'shifted' toward this speaker.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When <b>Auto matrix</b> is enabled then matrix is
automatically calculated and changed with parameters change. For example
if we change <b>Center</b> level we'll see factors change in 'C' column.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Settings description:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Auto gain control</b> - automatic gain control. It controls
current gain to prevent overflow. Curent gain is shown at <b>Gain</b>
level. When this option is disabled high-level signal is clipped on
overflow what leads to unpleasant distortions. When this option is
enabled then current gain will be decreased and overflow does not
happen. System behavior after overflow is defined by <b>One-pass
normalize</b> option. If <b>One-pass normalize</b> is disabled then
current gain will be gradually restored up to <b>Master</b> level. In
this case <b>Master</b> defines mean gain level. If it is many places
when overflow occurs then this behavior can lead to unpleasant&nbsp;
'jumps' of audio level. In this case do not set <b>Master</b> level too
high. This mode is recommended if overflow is not expected. If <b>One-pass
normalize</b> option is enabled then gain level will not be restored
after overflow. So each overflow decreases probability and 'strength' of
next overflow and after some time gain will be stabilized to some mean
value. Usually it happens after about ~10min of film playback. In this
case <b>Master</b> level means initial gain for one pass normalization
algorithm and may be set to maximum. This mode can provide maximum
loudness with minimal artifacts. (see also <a href="#max_loud">Maximum
loudness</a>)<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>One-pass normalize</b> - one pass normalizaion. See <b>Auto
gain control</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Auto matrix</b> - automatic calculation of mixer matrix. When
this option is enabled matrix editing direct is disabled. Gain levels
for <b>LFE</b>, <b>Voice</b> and <b>Surround</b> are parameters for
matrix calculation. When this option is disabled  next controls loose
influence: gain levels for <b>LFE</b>, <b>Voice</b> and <b>Surround</b>,<b>
Normalize matrix</b>, <b>Expand stereo</b>, <b>Voice control</b>, <b>Expand
stereo</b>. Following controls are remain to work: <b>Master</b>, <b>Gain</b>,<b>
DRC level</b>, <b>DRC power</b>, <b>One-pass  normalize</b>. Direct
matrix edit is enabled.</li>
  <li><b>Normalize marix</b> - matrix normalization. When this option is
enabled matrix is normalized so it is no overflow at output (sum of
channels at   output &lt; 1). But when one of gain levels (<b>LFE</b>, <b>Voice</b>
or <b>Surround</b>) changes other   gain level will be also changed
(for example if we increase level  of LFE all other channels level will
be decreased). If this option is disabled it allows   to avoid this
effect. But overflow is possible in this case. So it is better    to
decrease <b>Master</b> gain when this option is disabled.</li>
  <li><b>Expand stereo</b> - works only if it is no surround channels in
AC3 stream. In this case it allows to amplify surround information with <b>Surround</b>
gain control (that have no effect by default if it is not surround
channels at input). If it is surround channels at output this option
will route surround information there, i.e. allows surround upmix.
Techincally it controls out-of-phase audio components (channel
differences) and routes it to surround channels if they are exists.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Voice control</b> - works only if it is no center channel in
AC3 stream. In this case it allows to control center with <b>Voice</b>
gain control (that have no effect by default in absence of center
channel at input). If it is center speaker specified at output
configuration then this option will route center signal there. With <b>Expand
stereo</b> option allows full stereo to multichannel upmix. I.e. make
center and surround speakers to work even if input is just stereo.
Techincally it controls in-phase audio components (equal in both
channels) and routes it to center speaker if it is exists.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>B</b><b>ass redir</b> - Bass redirection. Route basses from all
channels to subwoofer. Works only if it is subwoofer at output speakers.
Highly recommended for systems with separate subwoofer (look <a href="#lfe">What is LFE?</a>). Basses are routed before mixing so
basses are shown at LFE input level (although 'real' LFE may be absent).
Cutoff&nbsp; frequency is 375Hz (for 48000Hz sampling frequency).</li>

<h3><a name="equalizer"></a>Equalizer and delays.</h3>
<div align="center"><img src="pic/equalizer.gif" title="" alt="" width="628" height="427"><br>
</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right part is fully about equalizer. Everything is
obvious so I will not bother myself with full description ;-).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left top corner are delay settings to compensate
different distances to speakers. Ideally all speakers should be at equal
distance to listener so sound emitted simultaneously from all speakers
reach listener at the same time. Otherwise sound picture will be
distorted. But in practice distance to speakers may be different. To
compensate this difference sound should be delayed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delay value may be set directly in ms or samples.
Negative value means that channel should be reproduced 'earlier' than
'null time' (if speaker is placed farther then it should start to work
earlier because sound needs more time to reach listener).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For convenience it is possible to set distance to
speakers. In this case positive values means negative delay for speaker
start to work earlier. Negative values means positive delay.<br>

<h2><a name="lfe"></a>What is LFE?</h2>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First and most important thing is that LFE is not
the same thing as subwoofer! And 5.1 in case of AC3 is not the same as
5.1 in case of computer acoustics.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AC3 format was created for cinema rather than
computer acoustics. In theaters acoustics is well enough to reproduce
low frequencies. LFE channel was designed for powerful low frequency <i>effects</i>,
i.e. effects that usual acoustics cannot handle. So all channels in ac3
stream contains low frequencies and LFE works only in certain moments to
help main speakers to quake the walls and earth. And it is quite
possible that LFE will not be enabled during the film. And it is normal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer acoustics is totally different. Most of 5.1
systems cannot reproduce low frequencies through satellites at all. So
subwoofer must work all the time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if we connect 5.1 acoustics and start to watch
movie with 5.1 sound track with subwoofer designated only for LFE
channel we will not hear basses at all!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Threrfore if acoustics have separate subwoofer it is
highly recommended to route there basses from all channels (since <i>all</i>
channels have basses). I.e. enable <b>Bass redirection</b> in filter
properties. Or use analogous option in sound card driver settings (if
exists) and turn filter option off. Some may ask about 'right' playback.
This people should read this document: (<a href="http://www.dolby.com/tech/c.in.0011.LFE.pdf">http://www.dolby.com/tech/c.i
n.0011.LFE.pdf</a>) with explanation about LFE role and how to handle

<h3><a name="lfe_mix"></a> LFE mixing.</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it is no separate subwoofer at output
configuration LFE is mixed only to front channels. If rear channels are
powerful enough we can mix LFE there for louder effects: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Start film playback<br>
  </li>
  <li>Open filter's properties (note that WMP v7+ does not allow this!).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Turn <b>Auto Matrix</b> off.</li>
  <li>In LFE matrix column set '1' (for example) in SR and SL rows</li>
  <li>Save this matrix.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3><a name="swap_speakers"></a> Swap channels.</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For better understanding read <a href="#mixer">Mixer
settings</a> section first (at mixer matrix description).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want real center channel on 4- channel sound
card? It is possible. Of cource it is impossible to get 5 channels out
of 4-channel sound card but we can use one of rear speakers as center,
i.e. make 3/1 (3 front / 1 rear) configuration instead of 2/2 (2 front /
2 rear).
<ul>
  <li>Start film playback.</li>
  <li>Turn <b>Auto Matrix</b> on. (it will allow to get basis matrix).</li>
  <li>Set 3/1 output configuration. By now we have no center channel so
center will be mixed to front channels by drivers. But we'll trick them
later.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Set our favorite settings (gain levels, etc) </li>
  <li>Turn <b>Auto Matrix</b> off.</li>
  <li>At this stage we have basis matrix. We will play cener through
rear right speaker. So copy all values from 'C' row to 'SR' row and then
fill 'C' row with zeros. Now matrix is ready.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Save matrix.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Physically move rear right speaker to center.</li>
  <li>Set 2/2 as output configuration. Now driver thinks that we give
real 2/2 channels but know nothing about our little trick, that we use
rear right as center :).</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="max_loud"></a>Maximum loudness<br>
</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it seems that standard settings are too silent it
can be fixed. Actually standard settings produce standard output. And
any manipulations lead to deviations from standard.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First that should be noted is that most films are
normalized to avoid overflows. So if we just raise gain level because
sound is too silent at one moment at some other moment overflow may
occur.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 3 main methods to avoid overflows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Signal clipping. Signal above maximal level is clipped. It leads
to noticeable distortions.</li>
  <li>Auto gain control. At overflow gain level automatically
decreases. It do not produce noticable distortions but big level jumps
may be noticable and annoying.</li>
  <li>Dynamic range compression (DRC). It is kind of auto gain control
controlled by marks in ac3 stream placed by sound producer.</li>
</ul>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simplest method to increase loudness is disable <b>Auto
gain control</b> and raise <b>Master</b> gain level. In this case
overflows will be clipped. This method increases loudness to the
prejudice of quality.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More advanced method is to enable <b>Auto gain
control</b>, enable <b>Normalize</b> and raise <b>Master</b> gain level
(till maximum level maybe). In this case after overflow gain level will
be decreased. After some time gain will almost stop changing. In this
case can get maximum loudness with maximum quality. This methods have
imperfecttions. First it is some time needed for gain to stabilize.
Second, our main goal to clearly hear low-level sound may not be
reached. This method may be recommended as quick way to get maximum
loudness with minimum artefacts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As kind of previous method <b>Normalize</b> may be
turned off. In this case gain level after overflow will&nbsp; be
gradually restored up to <b>Master</b> level. This method is more
sensible to choice of <b>Master</b> level. When <b>Master</b> level is
too high and it is much of overflows (what is the consequence of high <b>Master</b>
level) frequent and sharp gain changes may be annoying. Previous method
is devoid of this defect because current gain level is not raising after
overflow. But now we can hear low-level sounds&nbsp; (speech for
example) after explosions (after some time after it). But speech in
between of explosions will be masked agian. This method is recommended
for insignificant increase of <b>Master</b> level when it is expected
rare overflows or no overflows at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next method is to use dynamic range compression
(enable <b>Use DRC</b> option) with <b>Master</b> level raised. Current
DRC gain level is shown at respective indicator. At silent scenes it
should raise and at loud scenes it should lower. It is possible that
effect from DRC is not enough so it is possible to increase effect with <b>DRC
level</b> control. It is obvious that 'jumps' of loudness are more
noticable with high DRC level. So it should be choosen carefully to make
silent sounds clearly audible on the one hand and minimize gain jumps on
other hand. In this method gain jumps caused by two reasons: DRC itself
and auto gain control. To avoid some gain jumps auto gain can be
disabled. But in this case clipping distortions may appear. So it is
needed to maintain some kind of balance between all this factors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next parameters affect loudness: <b>Master</b>, <b>Auto
gain control</b>, <b>Normalize</b>,<b>Use DRC</b>, <b>DRC Level</b>.
All this paramteres should be adjusted individually depending on type of
acoustics, listener, and movie itself (lazy sound producer forgot to set
DRC marks :-).<br>
