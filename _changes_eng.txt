<b>1.20b</b> -
  * Correct work with 14bit DTS
  + SPDIF input support
  + Autodetection of SPDIF stream in PCM16 data
  + Raw SPDIF/DTS passthrough mode support
  + DTS conversion to 14bit to decrease the level of possible noise

<b>1.11</b> - 28.10.06
  Stable version.

  * Now filter saves output settings to preset 
    (so now you can create presets with different output configurations)
  * Tray icon and some other options display fixed
  * Fixed crash with TMPEnc

<b>1.10b</b> - 27.09.06
  Work on stability continues. Now filter shows good stability, therefore its
  status changes to beta and it may be recommended to replace any previous
  version.

  Some additional work was done:
  * Sometimes SPDIF mode cannot be set because of post-processing filters
    that do not support spdif output. Now it's an additional option to force
    this problem. Read here for more info:

    (thanks to LESAGE Aurelien for testing)
  * DivX player now works with SPDIF
  * Some players do not allow to configure filters. Now AC3Filter has tray icon
    to access filter's settings.

  Known problems:
  * AC3 encode does not work with some receivers
  * Incorrect playback of some 14bit DTS files

  Changelog:
  + Tray icon
  + 'Disallow PCM in SPDIF mode' option added
  * Divx Player now works with SPDIF output
  * AC3Config app does not crash, but reports an error when filter is uninstalled.
